    bohnBot: `The Bohn Bot is a application that uses the Twitter API to interact with Dr. Bohns twitter account. \n
This application was created using Python and the Tweepy library. It was my first even driven application and was a great learning experience.
The Application allowed for a user to input the following parameters:\n
Twitter Handle: The twitter handle of the user you want to interact with\n
Key Words: The key words you want to search for in the users tweets\n
Number of Tweets: The number of tweets you want to search through\n
What to tweet: The message you want to tweet at the user\n
The application would then search through the users tweets and tweet at them if the key words were found, usually searching for good morning tweets.

    bohnZone: `
The Bohn zone is a website I created for my classmates to interact with my favorite professor Dr. Bohn. \n
Students can submit questions, comments, memes, etc to be anonymously sent to Dr. Bohns twitter account. (content moderated by me)
The website is built using React.js, Node.js, and Firebase.
The website is currently no longer up (as of Jun 15, 2023), but was used heavily over the course of the 3 years by peers and professors alike.
